## Introduction
This project, developed as part of an introductory robotics course, is an advanced autonomous robot designed to navigate and perform object detection in a hospital environment. The robot follows a path, detects objects, and interacts with patients through smart functionalities.

## Features
- **Line Following**: The robot follows a black line on the ground using a camera and image processing.
- **Object Detection**: The robot uses Aruco markers and OpenCV to detect and track objects in its vicinity.
- **Smart Curtain Control**: Adjusts room lighting and curtains based on environmental conditions.
- **Voice Assistant**: Interacts with patients by asking health-related questions.

## Project Layers

### Image Processing Layer

As part of the Image Processing Group, I contributed to developing the robot's vision system. Here's a detailed breakdown of the steps we followed:

#### Image Processing in Room:

#### Steps:
1. **Data preparation**:
- We captured digital images using a camera mounted on the robot, which recorded the live feed as it navigated the environment.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
- Performed noise reduction techniques such as Gaussian blur to remove unwanted noise from the images.
- Resized the images to a standard resolution for consistent processing.
- Converted the color images to grayscale and applied a threshold for binary conversion (black and white).
3. **Image Segmentation**:
- Segmented areas of interest, particularly the black path line, from the surrounding white background using masking techniques.
- Applied contour detection to isolate the largest black area, ensuring the robot focused on the correct path.
  
4. **Center Line Detection**:
- Used image moments to calculate the center of the largest detected contour (black path line).
- Marked this center with a visual white dot to keep track of the robot's alignment with the path.
5. **Path Adjustment**:
- Calculated the robotâ€™s required movement by analyzing the position of the center dot relative to the image frame.
- Defined the "center" range as being between 190 and 290 pixels from the top of the screen (left-right axis in portrait mode).
- Based on this analysis:
   - If the center dot was outside this range, instructions were sent to the motors to rotate either left or right.
   - If the dot was within the center range, the robot continued moving straight.
6. **Error Calculation**:
- Computed an error variable based on the deviation of the center dot from the optimal center range.
- Sent this error data to the PID controller, which adjusted the speed of the motors for smooth turning and movement.

7. **Visualization**:
- For debugging and real-time tracking, we visualized the contours, mask, and main frame, along with the identification circle representing the detected center.

#### Object Detection in Hallways:
We used **Aruco markers** to assist in object localization, which helped guide the robot. The markers provide accurate tracking and orientation feedback, making them ideal for high-speed real-time applications.

##### You can see the Aruco markers detection below:

##### Challenges:
- Managing image processing at high speeds caused the robot to veer due to speed discrepancies between motors.
- Tuning the PID controller to adjust motor speeds based on real-time feedback.
